# Unity
A collection of Unity projects I've created so far.

## 3D Tower Defense
Thanks to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beuoNuK2tbk&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4u5jX8za5iU1cqnQPmbzG0&index=1 "YouTube- Playlist") tutorial series I've created a 3D Tower Defense Game and learned a lot of things, for example:
- Creating a main menu
- Switching between scenes
- Fading between scenes
- Using the UI system of Unity by creating buttons, overlays, healthbars, text and more
- Instantiating prefabs, particle systems, ...
- Creating particle systems
- Using coroutines
- ... and MUCH more.

### Here are some screenshots of the game:
